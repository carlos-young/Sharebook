The source code for our files in CSCI 487. We have planned on creating a dropbox like database with our main focus being around college
students. This target audience is ideal because they are always sharing files either it be music or class notes. Our main objectives are
as followed.

1) Properly create a database that allows user to upload files,delete and edit files as pleased on our server.
2) Allow users to login into the domain of files with their username and password associated with their personal accounts.
3) Share files between user accounts 
4) Secure certain information about their files while still showing other users what files you have uploaded.
5) Display data in a newsfeed like layout to make the view more user friendly. 
6) Once users have successfully shared documents with others, a notfication should appear on the feed showing what just occured.
7) Users should be able to log out of the database and files be secure and accessible next time logging into the server.


Our Fall 2013 semester has ended and this project is coming to a close. We were not able to accomplish all of the planned tasked that we intended from the beginning. We got the foundation completed, users are able to register,sign in, sign out and upload documents to our databases. We were not able to play with the CSS like we wanted to to give the website a more friendly appereance. This projecdt was a great idea and a good learning experience on rails and what we could possibly get done in a 2 month time period.
