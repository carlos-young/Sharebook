The source code for our files in CSCI 487. We have planned on creating a dropbox like database with our main focus being around college
students. This target audience is ideal because they are always sharing files either it be music or class notes. Our main objectives are
as followed.

1) Properly create a database that allows user to upload files,delete and edit files as pleased on our server.
2) Allow users to login into the domain of files with their username and password associated with their personal accounts.
3) Share files between user accounts 
4) Secure certain information about their files while still showing other users what files you have uploaded.
5) Display data in a newsfeed like layout to make the view more user friendly. 
6) Once users have successfully shared documents with others, a notfication should appear on the feed showing what just occured.
7) Users should be able to log out of the database and files be secure and accessible next time logging into the server.


As of now we have "files" that are already on the database and User could potientially upload a new one or edit one of the current
ones along with any new one uploaded. We have not yet completed the login userstory that allows everyone their own seperate work
space. This would require another server to save the users login information. This is our next goal, if this task can not be created
we would at least like to attempt to export the file for sharing or complete the whole graphical layout on the main page 
after login.
